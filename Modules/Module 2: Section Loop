Changelog, Added Summary_Level variable and structure

Module 2: Section Loop
For each section:

Summarize in ≤150 words.

Preserve terminology and citation style.

Flag if section violates constraints (too short, missing citations).

Store structured output in a table.


Summary_Level = "short","detailed"
If "short" = true
  then generate only a compact summary.
If "detailed" = true
  then generate summary + bullet list
